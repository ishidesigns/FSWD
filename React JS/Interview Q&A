#1 Question. What is Virtual DOM? Which data structure is used for the comparison of actual DOM & Virtual DOM?
Answer: First we should know what the DOM is : DOM Is also known as Domain Object Model. Also you can say It is the heierarchy structure or tree structure of the HTML Content like
<!Doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>
Ishika Web Page
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Welcome to the IshiDesign Github Page
</h1>
</body>
<html>
In DOM we can see the abpove contents in top to Down arrangement.

#Virtual DOM: Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of the User Interface on the other hand real DOM is synced with react DOM and will be kept in memory.

Example: Suppose we have a college website in which we want to check courses of specific branch let say B.Tech CSE then virtual DOM will load only that specific branch. 
Means it will not load other branch so that loading time will be decreased and we can make our website more User Friendly. 
Best Example React JS is providing the feature of Virtual DOM.


#2nd Part Answer: ReactJS using diff algorithm compares both the Virtual DOM to find the minimum number of steps to update the Real DOM.

#2 Question. What is JSX? Does Browser understand JSX Directly. It is mendatory to use JSX in react Application?
Answer: JSX stands for Java Script and XML widely used in React Application. Basically it is the Combination of Javascript , CSS & HTML. 
But the browser does not understand this JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code. 
This is because we're assigning an HTML tag to a variable that is not a string but just HTML code.

As JSX Code is easy to write because classical render code method was lengthy, example:

class JSXDemo extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>This is JSX</h1>;
    }
}
//JSX Way Code

ReactDOM.render(<JSXDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
//Classic render
-------------------------

#3 Question: How many types of Components are there in React?
Answer: In React JS there are 2 types of Components: 1:Class Component, 2: Functional Component. As per official Documentation of React it is suggested 
to use Functional Component because it has the hooks concept for state management.
-------------------------

#4 Question: ComponentwillUnmount is used for? Give a use case to elaborate the functionality?
Answer: The componentWillUnmount() method allows us to execute the React code when the component gets destroyed or unmounted from the DOM (Document Object Model). 
This method is called during the Unmounting phase of the React Life-cycle i.e before the component gets unmounted.
--------------------------

#5. What is difference between State/props? Props are mutable or not? Parent Component can change value of state in child component?
Answer: If I am talking about the main key difference then State is used to manage the changing of state on the other hand props are 
used to pass data from parent component to child component. State is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled 
by whatever renders the component.

First what is mutable, mutable are those in which changes are possible. But as per the definition of props these are using to pass values from parents 
to child component. So props are not mutable they are immutable. But for your knowledge in React States are mutable as they are changable.
