#1. What is Virtual DOM? Which data structure is used for the comparison of actual DOM & Virtual DOM?
Answer: First we should know what the DOM is : DOM Is also known as Domain Object Model. Also you can say It is the heierarchy structure or tree structure of the HTML Content like
<!Doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>
Ishika Web Page
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Welcome to the IshiDesign Github Page
</h1>
</body>
<html>
In DOM we can see the abpove contents in top to Down arrangement.

#Virtual DOM: Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of the User Interface on the other hand real DOM is synced with react DOM and will be kept in memory.

Example: Suppose we have a college website in which we want to check courses of specific branch let say B.Tech CSE then virtual DOM will load only that specific branch. Means
it will not load other branch so that loading time will be decreased and we can make our website more User Friendly. Best Example React JS is providing the feature of Virtual DOM.
