#1. What is Virtual DOM? Which data structure is used for the comparison of actual DOM & Virtual DOM?
Answer: First we should know what the DOM is : DOM Is also known as Domain Object Model. Also you can say It is the heierarchy structure or tree structure of the HTML Content like
<!Doctype html>
<html>
<head>
<title>
Ishika Web Page
</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>
Welcome to the IshiDesign Github Page
</h1>
</body>
<html>
In DOM we can see the abpove contents in top to Down arrangement.

#Virtual DOM: Virtual DOM is the virtual representation of the User Interface on the other hand real DOM is synced with react DOM and will be kept in memory.

Example: Suppose we have a college website in which we want to check courses of specific branch let say B.Tech CSE then virtual DOM will load only that specific branch. 
Means it will not load other branch so that loading time will be decreased and we can make our website more User Friendly. 
Best Example React JS is providing the feature of Virtual DOM.


#2nd Part Answer: ReactJS using diff algorithm compares both the Virtual DOM to find the minimum number of steps to update the Real DOM.


#2. What is JSX? Does Browser understand JSX Directly. It is mendatory to use JSX in react Application?
Answer: JSX stands for Java Script and XML widely used in React Application. Basically it is the Combination of Javascript , CSS & HTML. 
But the browser does not understand this JSX because it's not valid JavaScript code. 
This is because we're assigning an HTML tag to a variable that is not a string but just HTML code.

As JSX Code is easy to write because classical render code method was lengthy, example:

class JSXDemo extends React.Component {
    render() {
        return <h1>This is JSX</h1>;
    }
}
//JSX Way Code

ReactDOM.render(<JSXDemo />, document.getElementById('root'));
//Classic render
