JS Questions
1.  What is js.
-> this is a programming language which is used to add behaviour to web page.

2. What are the different data types present in javascript.
-> Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, BigInt, String, Symbol

3. Difference b/w var,let and const.
-> var - functional/ local/ global scope, can be updated and redeclared, can be accessed without initialization, default value - undefined
-> let - block scope, can be updated but cannot be redeclared, cannot be accessed without initialization and returns error
-> const - block scope, cannot be updated and redeclared, cannot be accessed without initialization

4. Explain Hoisting in javascript.
-> moving all the variable to the top before executing the code

5. Output for :- 
var a; 
console.log(a); 
a = 10;

-> undefined

6. What is the difference between == and ===.
-> == - only compares the value and not datatype. 
      - ex. 100 == "100" is true
-> === - checks the value and strictly checks the datatype also
       - ex. 100 === "100" is false

7. What is difference between value type and refernce type?
=> Passing by value means that every time you assign a value to a variable, a copy of that value is created.
      let a = 1;
      let b = a;
      b = b + 2;
      console.log(a); // 1
      console.log(b); // 3
      
   When creating an object you're given a reference to that object. If 2 variables hold the same reference, then changing the object reflects in both variables.
      let x = [1];
      let y = x;
      y.push(2);
      console.log(x); // [1, 2]
      console.log(y); // [1, 2]
