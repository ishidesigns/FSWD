JS Questions

1.  What is js.
-> this is a programming language which is used to add behaviour to web page.

2. What are the different data types present in javascript.
-> Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number, BigInt, String, Symbol

3. Difference b/w var, let and const.
-> var - functional/ local/ global scope, can be updated and redeclared, can be accessed without initialization, default value - undefined
-> let - block scope, can be updated but cannot be redeclared, cannot be accessed without initialization and returns error
-> const - block scope, cannot be updated and redeclared, cannot be accessed without initialization

4. Explain Hoisting in javascript.
-> moving all the variable to the top before executing the code

5. Output for :- 
var a; 
console.log(a); 
a = 10;

-> undefined

6. What is the difference between == and ===.
-> == - only compares the value and not datatype. 
      - ex. 100 == "100" is true
-> === - checks the value and strictly checks the datatype also
       - ex. 100 === "100" is false

7. What is difference between value type and refernce type?
-> Passing by value means that every time you assign a value to a variable, a copy of that value is created.
      let a = 1;
      let b = a;
      b = b + 2;
      console.log(a); // 1
      console.log(b); // 3
      
   When creating an object you're given a reference to that object. If 2 variables hold the same reference, 
   then changing the object reflects in both variables.
      let x = [1];
      let y = x;
      y.push(2);
      console.log(x); // [1, 2]
      console.log(y); // [1, 2]

8. What are closures?
-> combination of function with reference to its surrounding state.
-> gives access to outer function's scope from inner function.

9. What are callbacks?
-> A callback is just a function that's passed into another function, 
with the expectation that the callback will be called at the appropriate time. 
-> Callbacks are used to be the main way asynchronous functions are implemented in JavaScript.

10. What are objects in JS?
-> An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. 
-> These usually consist of several variables and functions 
(which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects).

-> Example, 
const person = {
  name: ['Bob', 'Smith'],
  age: 32,
  bio: function() {
    console.log(`${this.name[0]} ${this.name[1]} is ${this.age} years old.`);
  },
  introduceSelf: function() {
    console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name[0]}.`);
  }
};
-> Accessed using dot notation and bracket notation
-> using dot notation, person.name
-> using bracket notation, person['name']

11. splice and slice methods of arrays in JS?
-> splice: 
      - returns removed items 
      - changes original array
      - can take more than 1 argument
-> slice : 
      - returns selected items
      - doesn't change original array
      - takes 2 arguments


9. Is JS single threaded? if yes, how is it asynchronous?
-> Yes JS is single threaded.
->
